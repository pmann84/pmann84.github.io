## Adding Blog Posts

Put posts in your `_posts` directory. These are written in markdown, simply use an existing post as a template.

Note that because this site uses Jekyll to generate the content, Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.markdown`

where the date is in the format `XXXX-XX-XX`. 

## Running the Blog Locally

You can run the blog locally by running the following command:

```bundle exec jekyll serve```

## Publishing the Blog

To publish the blog, simply commit and push your changes to the repository. The site might take a few minutes to update.
