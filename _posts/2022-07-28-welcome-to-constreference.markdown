Welcome to the constreference github pages site! This will hopefully serve as a replacement for the old [wordpress site](constreference.wordpress.com/). I hope to migrate all the old content over to here as and when I get to it, but will try to add new content here.

If anyone else other than myself actually looks here then this site basically serves as a knowledge dump of stuff I've used over the years. Some stuff is more of a reference and some stuff is more of an exploration of ideas.

Enjoy!
