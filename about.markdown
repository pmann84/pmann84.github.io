A place for pieces of knowledge that I'm bound to forget on topics spanning programming, maths, science and everything inbetween. You can find the old constreference site [here](constreference.wordpress.com).

Some of the content here has code examples in my github account [here](https://github.com/pmann84), but each post should reference the relevant repositories.
